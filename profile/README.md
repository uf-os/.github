### `[11-12-25]` SteamFrames Announced!
With the formal announcment today of the SteamFrames (and friends) I'll be much more seriously looking into Godot's XR stack. With no price announced and months to a year-ish likely before upstream Linux supports come to it to the degree of parity of say the Steamdeck -- I'll be holding off on the preorder, but in the interim I'll certainly going to put some real time into my Quest 3s now. `:3`
